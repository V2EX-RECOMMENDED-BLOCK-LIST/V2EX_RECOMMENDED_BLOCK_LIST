## Purpose

The main purpose of this list is to punish ill-behaved users in a self-governed way, rather than relying on the adminstrators. 
Everyone is free to add a user to the list, and everyone is free to examine the whole list and determine whether to block a user himself or not. 

The main difference of this project from the previously existing ones is that it's purely decentralized. This repository only aims to provide ideas/tools, without affecting the actual list at all.
